We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:






## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-gcp-storage/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Default Bucket
```hcl
module "bucket" {
source = "clouddrove/storage/google"
version     = "1.0.0"


name        = "storage-bucket"
environment = "test-main-bukcet"
label_order = ["name", "environment"]
location   = "US"
project_id = "clouddrove"

#website
website = {
main_page_suffix = "index.html"
not_found_page   = "404.html"
}

#logging
logging = {
log_bucket        = module.bucket_logs.bucket.id
log_object_prefix = "gcs-log"
}

#cors
cors = [{
origin          = ["http://image-store.com"]
method          = ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"]
response_header = ["*"]
max_age_seconds = 3600
}]

# versioning
versioning = true

#lifecycle_rules
lifecycle_rules = [{
action = {
type          = "SetStorageClass"
storage_class = "NEARLINE"
}
condition = {
age                        = 60
created_before             = "2018-08-20"
with_state                 = "LIVE"
matches_storage_class      = ["STANDARD"]
num_newer_versions         = 10
custom_time_before         = "1970-01-01"
days_since_custom_time     = 1
days_since_noncurrent_time = 1
noncurrent_time_before     = "1970-01-01"
}
}]
}
```

|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| bucket\_id | Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to | `string` | `""` | no |
| cors | The bucket's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration. Multiple blocks of this type are permitted. | `any` | `[]` | no |
| default\_event\_based\_hold | (Optional) Whether or not to automatically apply an eventBasedHold to new objects added to the bucket. | `bool` | `null` | no |
| default\_kms\_key\_name | The bucket's encryption configuration | `string` | `null` | no |
| enabled | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| force\_destroy | When deleting a bucket, this boolean option will delete all contained objects. If you try to delete a bucket that contains objects, Terraform will fail that run. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| google\_storage\_bucket\_iam\_member\_enabled | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. sequence of application name and environment `name`,`environment`,'attribute' [`webserver`,`qa`,`devops`,`public`,] . | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |

| project\_id | GCS Project ID. | `string` | `""` | no |
| public\_access\_prevention | Prevents public access to a bucket. Acceptable values are `inherited` or `enforced`. If `inherited`, the bucket uses public access prevention. only if the bucket is subject to the public access prevention organization policy constraint. Defaults to `inherited`. | `string` | `""` | no |
| requester\_pays | Enables Requester Pays on a storage bucket | `string` | `true` | no |
| retention\_policy | Configuration of the bucket's data retention policy for how long objects in the bucket should be retained. | `any` | `null` | no |

| id | GCS bucket id. |
| name | GCS bucket name. |
| self\_link | URI of the GCS bucket. |

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
